# Unified HRMS Platform for MCD

## Overview
This project aims to design a unified Human Resource Management System(HRMS) for the Municipal Corporation of Delhi(MCD) to digitize and streamline HR operations across departments and zones.

The platform focuses on recruitment, attendance, payroll, transfers, performance tracking, grievance redressal, and inter-department coordination.

## Problem Statement
MCD manages thousands of employees using fragmented, manual, and department-specific HR processes. This leads to inefficiencies, delays, lack of transparency, and audit challenges.

## Proposed Solution
A centralized, workflow-driven HRMS tailored to municipal hierarchies with role-based access, phased digitization, and audit-ready design.
